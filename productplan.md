## âœ… Phase 7: TXT Format Generation (100% Complete)

### Overview
Add TXT format generation as an alternative to QSF - same workflow, different output format.

### Phase 7 Checkpoints:

- [x] Create `txtService.ts` in backend services
- [x] Implement `generateTXT()` method
- [x] Add `/api/survey/generate-txt` endpoint
- [x] Add `/api/survey/download-txt` endpoint
- [x] Update frontend API service to support TXT
- [x] Add "Download TXT" button in GenerationView
- [x] Implement `exportToFile()` for TXT format

### Implemented TXT Format (Qualtrics Simple Format):
Following Qualtrics Simple TXT format specifications:
- Each question separated by 2 blank lines
- Export tag (e.g., "Q1.") followed by question text
- 1 blank line between question and answer choices
- For likert scales: shows either ALL labels or ALL numbers (no mixing)
- For multiple choice: direct list of options
- Preserves original scale format from PDF

Example with complete labels:
```
Q1. I am satisfied with my current job

Strongly Disagree
Disagree  
Neutral
Agree
Strongly Agree
```

Example with numbers only (when labels are incomplete):
```
Q2. How fair is the current policy?

1
2
3
4
5
```
