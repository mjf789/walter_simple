Preparing a Simple Format TXT or DOCX File
Simple TXT formatting is appropriate for simple surveys that only have multiple choice and matrix questions. For more options, see Preparing an Advanced Format TXT File below.
TO FORMAT QUESTIONS IN SIMPLE TXT
* Each question should be separated by 2 lines of empty text.
   * You can set the question’s export tag by including it as a string followed by a period before the question text.
   * Example: If I put “Question12. This is my question,” then Question12 is my export tag.
* Place choices below the question text with a blank line between the question and the answer choices.
   * For multiple choice questions, answer choices should be in a bulleted or numbered list, separated from the question text by empty line.
   * Avoid using “:” in answer choices. You can add these in by editing the question in the survey builder after you’ve imported the file.
* Make a question multiple answer by adding “[[MultipleAnswer]]” on the line just below the question text.
* If you include a question with no answer choices, it will automatically become a text / graphic question.
* Designate a matrix question by separating statements and scale points into two groups with a space in between. The statements are the first group of choices while the scale points are the second group.
* Designate a new block by adding “[[Block]]”.
* Insert a page break by adding “[[PageBreak]]”.
* Add the “[[Randomize]]” tag before the list of answer choices to add simple choice randomization to the question.
EXAMPLE OF SIMPLE TXT FORMATTING:
Example – Simple Text File: Example.txt
MC1. This is a multiple choice question. Every question starts with a
export tag followed by a period. There should be a blank line between
the question text and the choices.


choice a
choice b
choice c
choice d


[[Block:My Block Name]]
MC2. This is a multiple choice- multiple answer question.
[[MultipleAnswer]]


choice a
choice b
choice c
choice d


[[PageBreak]]
MX1. This is a matrix question that has longer question text.
It is a matrix question because it has two groups of choices.
The choices ma, mb, and mc are statements while m1, m2, and m3
are scale points. 


ma
mb
mc


m1
m2
m3


MX2. This is a matrix-multiple answer question.
[[MultipleAnswer]]


ma
mb
mc


m1
m2
m3


[[Block]]
MC3. What is your age?


0-18
19-25
26-34
